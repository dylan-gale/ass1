assignment 1 artificial intelligence

I spent an unreasonable amount of time on a hash function for a table to 
keep record of already visited nodes. I saw immediately I could hash these 
sets of tiles as ternary values, however initializing a worst case table
of a proper size for this(six white(2), six black(1)), it continually segfaulted.
Needed to move on though and decided to use this anyway and to initialize my hash
tables later on to be of size
